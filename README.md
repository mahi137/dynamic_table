## React Dynamic Table with Dropdowns

This project is a React application that demonstrates a dynamic, interactive table with single and multi-select dropdowns, row addition, and customizable options. It highlights key React concepts like state management, reusable components, and dynamic rendering, combined with a clean and responsive UI.

## Features
## Dynamic Rows:

Add new rows to the table using the "Add New Row" button at the bottom-right of the page.

## Single-Select Dropdown (Label 1):

Dropdown options are dynamically filtered to prevent duplicate selections across rows.
Selected options display as chips with a close ("X") button for easy removal.
Removed options reappear in the dropdown list, making them reusable.

## Multi-Select Dropdown (Label 2):

Users can select multiple options that display as individual chips with close ("X") buttons for removal.
Includes a "Add New Option" feature to add custom items to the dropdown, which are immediately displayed as selected.

## Responsive UI:

Table and components adjust seamlessly for smaller screen sizes.

## Interactive and User-Friendly:

Hover effects, focus highlights, and consistent visual feedback for actions.

### Technologies Used

## Frontend Framework: 
React
Styling: CSS (Custom styles and responsive design)
Package Manager: npm or yarn (for managing dependencies)

## How to Use
## Add Rows:

Click on the "Add New Row" button to add a blank row to the table.
## Label 1 (Single-Select):

Choose an option from the dropdown. Selected options appear as chips.
To remove, click the "X" button on the chip. The option will return to the dropdown for reuse.

## Label 2 (Multi-Select):

Select multiple options from the dropdown. Selected items appear as chips.
Add a custom option using the "Add New Option" field at the bottom of the dropdown. The new option is automatically added to the list of selected items.

## Future Enhancements
Validation: Add input validations for dropdown selections.
Persistent State: Integrate a backend or local storage to persist data across sessions.
